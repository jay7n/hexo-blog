There're several reasons I have been trying to avoid playing with POST request as long as possible. Number One and the most, it's more complex to grasp than GET. Number Two, web proxies are always high tolerant (or more obscure on the opposite view) so that if something appears to be wrong, you barely know which side it belongs to.
