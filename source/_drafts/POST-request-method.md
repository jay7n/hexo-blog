title: POST request method

There're several reasons I would always try dodging POST request whenever I have a chance. 

Number One and the most, it's more complex to grasp than GET. Number Two, HTTP proxies are highly error tolerant (or more obscure on the other view) so that if something appears to be wrong, you barely know which side it belongs to. Number three, some head fields at different level have very similar and overlapped definitions which make things more tangled.
