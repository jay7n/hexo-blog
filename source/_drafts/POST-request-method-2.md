## There're two ways of encoding these key-value based data in POST



## Content-Type in the request header is to specify which type of data  you're using

## Mind that multipart/form-data is used to upload files. Why?

## Mind that there is also a sub header config under a file-field declaration and a same name 'Content-Type'

## When running in different environments(on browser or on the server), there're different ways to specify what is the Content-Type of a specified file in POST form-data
