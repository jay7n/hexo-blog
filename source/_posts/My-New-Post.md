Just as same as the Death is inevitable to human, Traversing Elements of a Sequence is also inevitable to programmers. If you're a developer who's been working for a few years, I bet you've probably written the for-loop-clause thousands of times.

When Given a list or an array, People Typically peek elements one by one in a simple and brutal-force way. Well,nothing is special. I didn't think about it too much either until I began to sharp my algorithm skills recently. Reading the section *LinkedList Questions* from the book *CTCI*, I learnt that there exists two pretty smart and elegant ideas when handling elem-traversal problems.


## 1. Recursion and Backward-Traversal


## 2. Fast/Slow Runner (or Pointer)
