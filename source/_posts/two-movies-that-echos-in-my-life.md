Out of all movies I've ever watched, there're two that didn't catch my attention at first, but always came to my mind in my later life as I grew older. They're 'The Matrix Reloaded' and '1408'.

'The Matrix Reloaded' is the 2nd sequel in The Matrix series. It tells a story of the supposed saviour discovering the truth of saving the world behind the curtain. Neo, the hero who had been widely believed to be the ultimate man to help people out of the control of machines, was told by the Architect who built The Matrix that he was not the only 'One' in history. Every once in a while, the system would introduce a saviour to re-balance the irreversible accumulated conflicts between human and machines. So there have been many 'ones' already existing before Neo. With that being said, everything is scheduled by the system, including accidents or miracles. 

I can find many echos of this aspect in real daily lives. For example, you are a specialist employed by a big company. What you know is you do have some talent capabilities that the company needs eagerly at the moment. What you wouldn't know is that you're not actually in particular special from the company's perspective. You're nothing more than a product of the time when the skills you own (not yourself) is needed by a corporation. You're neither the first such a role nor the last one.

Another example. You have worked so hard in the past that eventually you achieved the golden accomplishment, which is widely considered to be a rather difficult task. But before you begin to celebrate this big event in your life, you would soon realize that you're not the only one, even not the first one who passed this narrow bridge. In fact, there have been so many people who have been there already that you could have learned from their experience to get you there quicker.

'1408' is a horror movie that relates to another analogy in my life, with a deeper impact on me. This story depicts a writer who earned his living by exploring hotels, evaluating supernatural phenomena within the room and writing books about those experiences. One day despite others' oppositions, he stepped into the the notorious room 1408, where he turned out to confronted the real trouble. There're no doubt many ghosts showing up in the film, but the strongest impression it left me is that he never escaped from that room. For a long while He thought he had managed to escape, but in fact he hadn't. He had been being trapped forever in that room.

Sometimes, maybe not very common, you mistakenly assumed you've waken up from a dream, but you haven't, you were still in your upset nightmare, which was really a peculiar experience. That is, however, not much worth mentioning in this case. There're more than that in our daily lives. Had you ever encountered something that was truly a tough time in your life and finally you got over it? Probably you might think it'd just gone, would never ever show up again, but it turned out to be a wrong assumption. It was still there, just like the room 1408, waiting for you to visit again. The older you get, the more experiences like that you come across. Be it a fierce fight with your spouse, a serious illness that you had to fight against, or a failure on your business despite how much endeavor you paid for it, you name it.
